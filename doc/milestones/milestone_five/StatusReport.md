# Status Report 
As of now the following components of the game have been implemented. 
  
  - execution on Linux (OS X works but I haven't tested it rigorously)
  - The player can control and fly their spaceship. 
  - Asteroids can be generated. 
  - Planets can be generated. 

Since I'm the only member in the project. My responsibilities have been:

  - testing
  - coding
  - design

The remaining components to implement have been listed (sorted by priority). 
 
  - weapons
  - collision detection
  - gravitational interactions
  - scoring system
  - network interface for the multilayer component.
