# Proof of Concept

The game will be initially designed to run on two platforms; Linux and OS x. In order to ensure that the program runs on both systems. I'm going to be using make as my build system and git/github.com for source control. 

Sync the system uses makefiles then if needed I could import the project into an IDE such as CodeBlocks. For now though my IDE is essentially vim with code completion and c++ extensions. 

The repository to the project is available at [Github.com](https://github.com/McKizzle/AoS "AoS").
